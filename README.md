# Audibly
## _WPF M4B Audiobook player_
## Designed with Material Design

Audibly is a desktop audiobook player written in WPF .NET core
## Please note that this app currently supports M4B/M4B/MP3 file (single file for single book) only & the code is ugly- needs a cleanup.

## Features

## Import M4B folders as books in library - Folder should contain Cover.jpg/ *.jpg (works as cover image) and a single M4B/M4A/MP3 audio book file
